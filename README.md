Homework for Saarland's data sci Summer camp

Note that “gh-pages” was set as the default branch which will serve its content automatically for all eternity! (no dependence on you maintaining our servers past our eventual unfortunate demise).

Note also URL composition for hosted content, 

https://< organization >.github.io/< project >/< file >

for example, for saarland.html:

https://mathbiol.github.io/saarland2015/saarland.html

Finally note that other mime types can be served, including calling someone’s code straight from, for example

https://mathbiol.github.io/saarland2015/saarland.js,

which could be invoked directly through script tag loading via


``` <script src=“https://mathbiol.github.io/saarland2015/saarland.js”</script> ```

or 

jQuery.loadScript(‘https://mathbiol.github.io/saarland2015/saarland.js')

etc

one more note … see how github is throwing SSL for free
